WHERE 
  pickup_time NOT LIKE 'null' 
GROUP BY 
  runner_id 
ORDER BY 
  runner_id;
```

Answer:
| runner_id | count |
| --------- | ----- |
| 1         | 4     |
| 2         | 3     |

  COUNT(cust.pizza_id) 
FROM 
  pizza_runner.customer_orders cust 
  JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders runner ON cust.order_id = runner.order_id 
  JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn ON cust.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id 
WHERE 
  runner.pickup_time NOT LIKE 'null' 
GROUP BY 
  pn.pizza_name;
```

| pizza_name | count |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Meatlovers | 9     |

5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
```SQL
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT 
    cust.customer_id, 
    pn.pizza_name 
  FROM 
    pizza_runner.customer_orders cust 
    JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn ON cust.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
) 
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  SUM(
    (pizza_name = 'Meatlovers'):: INT
  ) Meatlovers, 
  SUM(
    (pizza_name = 'Vegetarian'):: INT
  ) Vegetarian 
FROM 
  cte 
GROUP BY 
  customer_id 
ORDER BY 
  customer_id;
```
```SQL
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT 
    cust.customer_id,
