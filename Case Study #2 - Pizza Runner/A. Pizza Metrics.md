  FROM 
    pizza_runner.customer_orders cust 
    JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn ON cust.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
) 
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  SUM(
    (pizza_name = 'Meatlovers'):: INT
  ) Meatlovers, 
  SUM(
    (pizza_name = 'Vegetarian'):: INT
  ) Vegetarian 
FROM 
  cte 
GROUP BY 
  customer_id 
ORDER BY 
  customer_id;
```
```SQL
WITH cte AS (
